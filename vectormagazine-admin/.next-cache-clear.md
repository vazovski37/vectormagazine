# Clear Next.js Cache

If you're experiencing module resolution errors, try:

1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete the `.next` folder: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
3. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

The packages are installed correctly in node_modules. This is likely a Next.js cache issue.
